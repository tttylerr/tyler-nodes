/**
	Trippy Snake - A 3D snake with silly lights.
	
	PLEASE don't use this as a reference for good code, I was just
	playing with three.js for the first time and came up with this.
	This code is awful, dirty and will eat your face if you ever 
	attempt to learn too much from this.
	Homwever, I release this code as ABSOLUTELY FREE and with no
	particular license, so do what the hell you want and credit me
	only if you feel like it. Goodbye :3
